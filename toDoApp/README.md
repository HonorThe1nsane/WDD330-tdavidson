# WDD330-Troy-ToDoApp
my todo application

things that it can do:
[] it can take input
[] it can output that input
[] you can check it as complete

things that it cannot do YET!
[] it cannot delete an item
[] it cannot sort through items
[] it cannot sort in local storage

All these things I am pretty close to completing.
